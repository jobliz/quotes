Anderson turns the fruit in his hand, studying it. It's more like a gaudy sea anemone or a furry puffer fish than a fruit. Coarse green tendrils protrude from all sides, tickling his palm. The skin has the rust-red tinge of blister rust, but when he sniffs he doesn't get any stink of decay. It seems perfectly healthy, despite its appearance.

"Ngaw," the peasant woman says again, and then, as if reading his mind. "New. No blister rust."

Anderson nods absently. Around him, the market soi bustles with Bangkok's morning shoppers.
Mounds of durians fill the alley in reeking piles and water tubs splash with snakehead fish and red-fin
plaa. Overhead, palm-oil polymer tarps sag under the blast furnace heat of the tropic sun, shading the
market with hand-painted images of clipper ship trading companies and the face of the revered Child
Queen. A man jostles past, holding vermilion-combed chickens high as they flap and squawk outrage
on their way to slaughter, and women in brightly colored pha sin bargain and smile with the vendors,
driving down the price of pirated U-Tex rice and new-variant tomatoes.

None of it touches Anderson.
